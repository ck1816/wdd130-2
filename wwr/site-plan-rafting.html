    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our growing business decided to start a website due to the increasing needs that can be met by an online presence.  
        We hope to serve our customers better by advertising our services this way and giving the customer more access to our adventures.  
        It should make it easier to reserve a spot on an adventure, check the schedule, book an adventure, or explore what we do.  This 
        will increase our revenue, customer satisfaction, educate the public on safety and best rafting practices, and share part of
        the adventure so it can be experienced from the website.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience are the adventurous on the go type who could be accessing the website from their mobile phones and also
         those ready to try a new adventure. For those interested in trying a new adventure, they need to see it to show them what 
         they can do.  Experiencing part of the adventures through the website will help them see what it's like and motivate them 
         to book their own adventure.  They could be using any device; laptop, desktop, or phone to access.  Phone access is very
         important because many adventurists may not have access to a computer, especially in the middle of an adventure.</p>
