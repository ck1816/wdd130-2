    <h2>Celest</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Celestia and I will answer to Celest for people who can't pronounce my name, but I prefer Celestia, especially with 
       church members who usually have no trouble with it.  I am from Olympia, WA, but live in Kingston. I have been a member of The Church of 
       Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints all my life. I live with my three younger children.  My oldest is on a mission in Charlotte, North 
       Carolina and loving it!  I love spending time with my children and family.</p>  
    <p>I love music, dance, and art. I used to be a musical theater major at BYUI and then a media production/music technology major at a
       University in London.  My major is now Software Development as an online student and I plan to end up with a Software Engineering Degree. 
       There are so many advantages for careers in web design or using the skills in your own business.  I have always wanted to learn this.  
       This is my first semester back in school after getting my AA many years ago at what is now BYU-Idaho.  I am so excited to finish my degree.</p>  
    <p>Being a student at BYU-Idaho is really amazing for me right now and it gives me so much hope for the future! I love talking about 
       the gospel while learning because all knowledge comes from God, so it enhances your learning.</p>
